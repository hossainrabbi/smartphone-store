            'The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is slightly taller and heavier than the S8+, but simply feels better built and more solid in your hand. The 6.3-inch Quad HD+ display is gorgeous and produces excellent contrast. The S-Pen now has a finer tip and is IP68 certified. You can use it to create hand-drawn GIFs, translate words, and search the web with Bixby Vision. This phone is powerful too thanks to the Exynos 9 Octa SoC and 6GB of RAM. The dual rear cameras are a first for the company and let you do things like Live Focus, which adds a pleasing bokeh effect behind your subject. The main sensor delivers excellent detail, both in daylight and at night. Battery life could have been better and we struggled to get a full day’s worth of usage out of each full charge.',
